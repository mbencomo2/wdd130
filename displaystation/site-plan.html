      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Retro video games are one of my favorite pastimes, especially Sony's PlayStation (TM) 2. With one of the largest libraries of classic video games, 
          it is great fun revisiting classic titles. However, it shouldn't take earning a degree on analogue TV signals or spending an arm or leg on a 
          fancy up-scaling device.  My aim is to help anyone who has wanted to enjoy their classic games with the hardware they already own, while 
          also learning what options are available to restore or enhance the experience.  To that end, my website would offer a simple to understand 
          layout with pages describing ways to connect to your TV and simple modifications so easy your grandma could do it. I already help many friends and 
          people on internet forums. Now is my chance to make a bigger impact on the community.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience are retro gamers and people who are interested in playing Playstation 1 and 2 consoles. The same principles
          apply to retro consoles as a whole, so most 5th generation console owners and older can also benefit from this site as well.
