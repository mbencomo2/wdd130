                <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                <img src="images/boy.png" alt="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/children">
                <p>
                    Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 
                    8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).
                    <br><br>
                    A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. 
                    Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the 
                    most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids 
                    which keep things very interesting.
                    <br><br>
                    Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for 
                    very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

                <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
                <img src="images/lifejacket.png" alt="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/lifejacket">
                <p>
                    As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure 
                    your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 
                    years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation 
                    device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give 
                    you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should 
                    prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <img src="images/t-shirt.png" alt="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/t-shirt">
                <p>
                    For clothing, wear swim suits or quick dry underwear as a base layer. Over the base layer, you can
                    choose to wear polypropylene if you are too cold or cotton if you are too warm. Large brim hats provide 
                    good protection from the sun during the day, just make sure it has a good strap. Make sure you wear 
                    sandals or water shoes, but if you are not used to hiking in these you can bring a broken-in pair of 
                    shoes you have hiked in before. Finally, for sleep wear some choose to sleep in their camp wear. Otherwise, 
                    you can bring something more comfortable to sleep in.
                    <br><br>
                    Make sure to bring a water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, 
                    waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm. Some optional items include: gloves, a fleece jacket, a towel, a bandana, or a 
                    small pillow. As for hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, 
                    extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment book, watercolors, journal and pen.

                <h2>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h2>
                <img src="images/rafting.png" alt="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/rafting">
                <p>
                    Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
                    <br><br>
                    You arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry 
                    sky, have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things 
                    and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, 
                    history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4pm or 5pm. After setting up your 
                    cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides 
                    prepare your dinner. Maybe it is something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon. Perhaps 
                    even dutch oven brownies. You won't forget the dutch oven brownies! After dinner it's more relaxing, 
                    and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more 
                    stars than you thought were possible.

                <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
                <img src="images/calendar.png" alt="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/calendar">
                <p>
                    If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 
                    months in advance is usually sufficient. <br><br>
